*Diggory* is a web service that calculate automatically information
about the upcoming Mozilla Holiday Worldwide.

It uses the information from `workalendar <https://github.com/novafloss/workalendar>`_ to do so.

You'd better use `Mozilla Publicly observed Holiday <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/embed?src=mozilla.com_34303638303130392d353231@resource.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Paris>`_ for now.
